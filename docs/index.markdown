# Odin
{: .mb-6}

**_Odin_**  is an open source diagnosis framework for generic machine learning **classification** tasks and for computer vision **object detection** and **instance segmentation** tasks that lets developers add meta-annotations to their data sets, compute performance metrics split by meta-annotation values, and visualize diagnosis reports.
<br>
**_Odin_**  is agnostic to the training platform and input formats and can be extended with application- and domain-specific meta-annotations and metrics with almost no coding.
